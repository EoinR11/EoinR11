What is up and Where is down. I recently finished an apprenticeship in software development, with a specialisation in Oracle database management. The LibraryDB repo is my final assessment from the apprenticeship. I work with SSMS and Oracle mainly but I also have some experience with Python, C#, HTML, C++, Java and Javascript.
